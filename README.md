# SORUL TRADINGBOT - Forex bot in Metatrader 5 🤖📈

## What is this project about
This project uses the ⭐🚀 [tradeo](https://github.com/sorul/tradeo) 🚀⭐ 
library to build a forex bot using MetaTrader 5.

I used Docker to create an image that contains Wine 🍷 and MetaTrader 5. 
I create a bind between the Docker container and the project to have access 
to the files generated by the bot.

## MetaTrader config

Run "make run_docker" to activate MetaTrader. Once it's available,
access it through the browser at localhost:3000.
If a connection error occurs on Debian, run the "make run_docker" command again.

1) Log in to your broker account.
2) Add the symbols you want to trade. 
There is the option for the bot to open them automatically, but I do not recommend it.
3) Download [mt_tb_expert](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sorul/tradeo/refs/heads/master/tradeo/mt_tb_expert.mq5) 
file and put it in the proper directory: ./metatrader/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/MetaTrader 5/MQL5/Experts/Advisors/mt_tb_expert.mq5
4) Open MetaEditor using the right-click on the remote desktop. 
Click on compile, and a new file with the .ex5 extension will be created.
5) Activate the "Algo Trading" button at the top of MetaTrader.
6) Activate the expert in any symbol chart, it does not matter which chart you use. 
But only in one of them.

## Environment variables
We copy the ".env" file suggested by the 
[README](https://github.com/sorul/tradeo?tab=readme-ov-file#execution-of-your-project-if-you-import-this-library) 
of the Tadeo library.

## How I execute the project

I edit de crontab (crontab -e):

```console
@reboot cd ~/git/sorul_tradingbot/ && make run_docker
*/5 * * * 0-5 cd ~/git/sorul_tradingbot/ && make run_forex
```
